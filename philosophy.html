          <h3>Book IV: On the Nature of the Universe</h3>
          <p>Everything is interwoven, and the web is holy; none of its parts are unconnected. They are composed harmoniously, and together they compose the world. One world, made up of all things. One divinity, present in them all.</p>

          <h3>Part 3: The Religious Nature</h3>
          <p>The Christian faith from the beginning is sacrifice: the sacrifice of all freedom, all pride, all self-confidence of the spirit; at the same time, enslavement and self-mockery, self-mutilation.</p>
          
          <h3>Part 9: What Is Noble?</h3>
          <p>Every enhancement of the type "man" has so far been the work of an aristocratic society—and it will be so again and again—a society that believes in the long ladder of an order of rank and differences in value between man and man.</p>

          <h3>Introduction: The Question of Being</h3>
          <p>We must raise anew the question of the meaning of Being. But are we nowadays even perplexed at our inability to understand the expression 'Being'? Not at all. So first of all we must reawaken an understanding for the meaning of this question.</p>
          
          <h3>Division 1: Dasein's Being-in-the-World</h3>
          <p>Dasein is an entity which does not just occur among other entities. Rather it is ontically distinguished by the fact that, in its very Being, that Being is an issue for it.</p>
          
          <h3>Division 2: Dasein and Temporality</h3>
          <p>Time must be brought to light and genuinely conceived as the horizon for all understanding of Being and for any way of interpreting it. In order to make this visible, we need an original explication of Time as the horizon of the understanding of Being.</p>

        content: `
          <h3>Part I: Defining Existentialism</h3>
          <p>Existentialism is nothing else than an attempt to draw all the consequences of a coherent atheistic position. It isn't trying to plunge man into despair at all. But if one calls every attitude of unbelief despair, like the Christians, then the word is not being used in its original sense.</p>
          
          <h3>Part II: Freedom and Responsibility</h3>
          <p>Man is condemned to be free. Condemned, because he did not create himself, yet is nevertheless at liberty, and from the moment that he is thrown into this world he is responsible for everything he does.</p>
          
          <h3>Part III: The Human Condition</h3>
          <p>When we say that man chooses himself, we do mean that every one of us must choose himself; but by that we also mean that in choosing for himself he chooses for all men.</p>

          <h3>Part IV: Of Human Bondage</h3>
          <p>Human infirmity in moderating and checking the emotions I name bondage: for, when a man is a prey to his emotions, he is not his own master, but lies at the mercy of fortune.</p>
          
          <h3>Part V: Of the Power of the Intellect</h3>
          <p>The mind's highest good is the knowledge of God, and the mind's highest virtue is to know God. The more the mind knows, the better it understands its forces and the order of nature.</p>

          <h3>Preface to the First Edition</h3>
          <p>Human reason has this peculiar fate that in one species of its knowledge it is burdened by questions which, as prescribed by the very nature of reason itself, it is not able to ignore, but which, as transcending all its powers, it is also not able to answer.</p>
          
          <h3>Transcendental Aesthetic: Space and Time</h3>
          <p>Space is not an empirical concept which has been derived from outer experiences. For in order that certain sensations be referred to something outside me, the representation of space must be presupposed.</p>
          
          <h3>Transcendental Logic: The Categories</h3>
          <p>Thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind. The understanding can intuit nothing, the senses can think nothing. Only through their union can knowledge arise.</p>
