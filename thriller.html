          <h3>Chapter 1: Friday, December 20</h3>
          <p>The trial was irretrievably over; everything that could be said had been said, but he had never doubted that he would lose. The written verdict was handed down at 10:00 on Friday morning, and all that remained was a summing up from the reporters waiting in the corridor outside the district court.</p>
          
          <h3>Chapter 5: The Vanger Family</h3>
          <p>Harriet Vanger had vanished on Children's Day in 1966. The day began with a parade through Hedestad, and Harriet had been with her family on the island. After the parade, the family gathered for lunch. Harriet said she felt sick and went to her room. Later, when her father went to check on her, she was gone.</p>
          
          <h3>Chapter 15: The Hacker</h3>
          <p>Lisbeth Salander was a pale, anorexic-looking young woman who had hair as short as a fuse, and a pierced nose and eyebrows. She had a wasp tattoo about an inch long on her neck, a tattooed loop around the biceps of her left arm and another around her left ankle.</p>

          <h3>Part One: Boy Loses Girl</h3>
          <p>When I think of my wife, I always think of her head. The shape of it, to begin with. The very first time I saw her, it was the back of the head I saw, and there was something lovely about it, the angles of it. Like a shiny, hard corn kernel or a riverbed fossil.</p>
          
          <h3>Chapter 5: Nick Dunne, The Day Of</h3>
          <p>My morning breath warmed the pillow, and I changed the subject in my mind. Today was not a day for second-guessing or regret, it was a day for doing. Downstairs, I could hear the return of a long-lost sound: Amy making breakfast. Banging wooden cupboards (rump-thump!), rattling containers of tin and glass (ding-ring!), shuffling and sorting a collection of metal pots and iron pans (ruzz-shuzz!).</p>
          
          <h3>Part Two: Boy Meets Girl</h3>
          <p>I was told love should be unconditional. That's the rule, everyone says so. But if love has no boundaries, no limits, no conditions, why should anyone try to do the right thing ever? If I know I am loved no matter what, where is the challenge?</p>

          <h3>Chapter 7: Dr. Lecter</h3>
          <p>Clarice Starling's heels clicked on the cement floor as she walked down the corridor. She carried her briefcase and a manila envelope. The corridor was cold and dead silent. She passed heavy doors with small windows reinforced by diamond-shaped steel lattices.</p>
          
          <h3>Chapter 15: Buffalo Bill</h3>
          <p>He peeled back the skin carefully, like he was opening a present. The girl was still alive when he started. He liked them alive. It was more interesting that way. He hummed as he worked, a tuneless melody that only he could hear.</p>

          <h3>Chapter 1: The Louvre, Paris</h3>
          <p>Renowned curator Jacques SauniÃ¨re staggered through the vaulted archway of the museum's Grand Gallery. He lunged for the nearest painting he could see, a Caravaggio. Grabbing the gilded frame, the seventy-six-year-old man heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and SauniÃ¨re collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas.</p>
          
          <h3>Chapter 5: Langdon and Sophie</h3>
          <p>Robert Langdon felt light-headed as he trudged toward the end of the hallway. The unsettling image of the curator's body remained locked in his mind. Jacques SauniÃ¨re did that to himself? Langdon turned the corner and saw the interrogation room was a one-way mirror. Inside, Sophie Neveu was standing over something on the floor.</p>
          
          <h3>Chapter 17: The Cryptex</h3>
          <p>This cryptex, Sophie explained, was the brainchild of Leonardo da Vinci. A portable vault whose contents could be protected by a series of rotating dials. She had seen a sketch of it in her grandfather's journal.</p>

          <p>The ferry plunged through the waves with a brutal, vertical motion that sent spray over the gunwales and made the deck shudder under Teddy's feet. He gripped the rail and watched the island grow larger before them, its cliffs rising from the sea like the dark, jagged teeth of some submerged leviathan.</p>
          
          <h3>Chapter 4: Ward C</h3>
          <p>They entered Ward C through a series of locked gates. The air was thick with the smell of ammonia and something elseâ€”something sour and vaguely biological. The patients shuffled by in loose-fitting garments, their eyes vacant or burning with some inner fire Teddy couldn't comprehend.</p>
          
          <h3>Chapter 9: The Lighthouse</h3>
          <p>Chuck said, "You really think she's up there?" Teddy looked up at the lighthouse perched on the cliff. "Where else could she be? This is the only place we haven't searched." They climbed the winding path as the storm gathered around them.</p>

          <p>There is a pile of clothing on the side of the train tracks. Light-blue clothâ€”a shirt, perhapsâ€”jumbled up in a clump of something dirty white. It's probably rubbish, part of a load dumped into the scrubby little wood up the bank. It could have been left behind by the engineers who work this part of the track, they're here often enough. Or it could be something else. My mother used to tell me that I had an overactive imagination; Tom said that, too. I can't help it, I catch sight of these discarded scraps, a dirty T-shirt or a lonesome shoe, and all I can think of is the other item waiting somewhere behind it, the hidden thing.</p>
          
          <h3>Part Two: Megan</h3>
          <p>I am no longer just a girl on the train, going back and forth without point or purpose. I am finally doing something. I am needed. I am fixed, anchored. I am a completely different person. I am still breathing, but I am not alive. I am not real.</p>
          
          <h3>Part Three: Anna</h3>
          <p>She's here again, I see her. She's sitting on the bench, same as always, same as yesterday and the day before. Her hair is lank and greasy, tucked behind her ears. She's wearing the same clothes she had on yesterday, the same clothes she wears every day. She stares at the house. My house.</p>

          <p>Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again. It seemed to me I stood by the iron gate leading to the drive, and for a while I could not enter, for the way was barred to me. There was a padlock and a chain upon the gate. I called in my dream to the lodge-keeper, and had no answer, and peering closer through the rusted spokes of the gate I saw that the lodge was uninhabited.</p>
          
          <h3>Chapter 5: Mrs. Danvers</h3>
          <p>She stood very straight and still, her hands folded in front of her, her eyes, in that white skull's face, fixed upon me. She was dressed all in black, and I thought of the medieval saints in the church at Kerrith, and how they too were draped in black.</p>
          
          <h3>Chapter 12: The West Wing</h3>
          <p>"This was her room. It's been kept exactly as she left it. Nothing has been altered since that last night." Mrs. Danvers pushed open the door and I followed her into the room. It was dark, the curtains drawn. The air was heavy with the scent of azaleas. I could make out the shape of a large bed, a dressing table, wardrobes.</p>
