                    <p>Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the end, keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island, and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted, I take up my pen in the year of grace 17__ and go back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Chapter III: The Black Spot</h3>
                    <p>About noon I stopped at the captain's door with some cooling drinks and medicines. He was lying very much as we had left him, only a little higher, and he seemed both weak and excited. "Jim," he said, "you're the only one here that's worth anything, and you know I've been always good to you. Never a month but I've given you a silver fourpenny for yourself. And now you see, mate, I'm pretty low, and deserted by all; and Jim, you'll bring me one noggin of rum, now, won't you, matey?"</p>
                    
                    <h3>Chapter XXVIII: In the Enemy's Camp</h3>
                    <p>The appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was altogether changed. Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast. Grey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface.</p>

                    <p>On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the three-master, the Pharaon from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples. As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d'If, got on board the vessel between Cape Morgion and Rion island.</p>

                    <p>Dantès passed through all the stages of torture natural to prisoners in suspense. He was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to hope; then he began to doubt his own innocence, which justified in some measure the governor's belief in his mental alienation; and then, relaxing his sentiment of pride, he addressed his supplications, not to God, but to man.</p>

                    <p>It is a curious thing that at my age—fifty-five last birthday—I should find myself taking up a pen to try to write a history. I wonder what sort of a history it will be when I have finished it, if ever I come to the end of the trip! I have done a good many things in my life, which seems a long one to me, owing to my having begun work so young, perhaps.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter X: The Witch-hunt</h3>
                    <p>On reaching our hut I motioned to Infadoos to enter with us. "Infadoos," I said, "we would speak with thee." "Let my lords say on." "It seems to us, Infadoos, that Twala the king is a cruel man." "It is so, my lords. Alas! the land cries out because of his cruelties. To-night ye shall see. It is the great witch-hunt, and many will be smelt out as wizards and slain."</p>

Martha must have concluded that she was very much behindhand, for the dinner had only just been put into the oven.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Chapter XIV: The Real Journey Begins</h3>
                    <p>At six in the morning we were ready to depart. The necessary arrangements for our descent were not difficult to make, as we simply had to lower our luggage by ropes to the bottom of the crater. Hans took charge of this part of the work, and soon all our packages were lying at the bottom of the abyss.</p>

"My dear Rose," I answered, laying down my egg-spoon, "why in the world should I do anything? My position is a comfortable one. I have an income nearly sufficient for my wants (no one's income is ever quite sufficient, you know), I enjoy an enviable social position: I am brother to Lord Burlesdon, and brother-in-law to the charming Countess of Burlesdon."</p>

                    <p>With Fritz von Tarlenheim and Colonel Sapt close behind me, I stepped out of the chapel porch. The scene was memorable. Before me was a wide gravelled court, six or seven yards across. Beyond this stretched another court, and beyond that again the great park.</p>

He went therefore to his appointment with Athos without a second, determined to be satisfied with those his adversary should choose. Besides, his intention was formed to make the brave Musketeer all suitable apologies, but without meanness or weakness.</p>

His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
