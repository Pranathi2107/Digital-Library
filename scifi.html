          <h3>Book One: Dune</h3>
          <p>A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV.</p>
          
          <h3>The Coming of Muad'Dib</h3>
          <p>Muad'Dib could indeed see the Future, but you must understand the limits of this power. Think of sight. You have eyes, yet cannot see without light. If you are on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond your valley.</p>
          
          <h3>Appendix I: The Ecology of Dune</h3>
          <p>The struggle between life and lifelessness is the theme of the planet Arrakis. To understand the relationship of this planet to the others in the Imperium, one must first appreciate its peculiar ecology.</p>

          <h3>Part I: The Psychohistorians</h3>
          <p>His name was Gaal Dornick and he was just a country boy who had never seen Trantor before. That is, not in real life. He had seen it many times on the hyper-video, and occasionally in tremendous three-dimensional newscasts covering an Imperial Coronation or the opening of a Galactic Council.</p>
          
          <h3>The Encyclopedists</h3>
          <p>Terminus was a world which, in the first year of the Foundation Era, knew nothing of the struggles that were to come. It was a world of fifty thousand, all dedicated to the creation of a Galactic Encyclopedia.</p>
          
          <h3>The Mayors</h3>
          <p>Salvor Hardin was the first mayor of Terminus City to be elected by the people. It is perhaps not too far-fetched to assume that the first election was the most significant one.</p>

          <h3>Chapter 1: Chiba City Blues</h3>
          <p>The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel. "It's not like I'm using," Case heard someone say, as he shouldered his way through the crowd around the door of the Chat. "It's like my body's developed this massive drug deficiency."</p>
          
          <h3>Chapter 5: Midnight in the Rue Jules Verne</h3>
          <p>The Villa Straylight was a singular structure, a mad combination of Gothic cathedral and Victorian railway station. It was built on a massive orbital rock, and its architecture reflected the paranoia of its inhabitants.</p>
          
          <h3>Chapter 10: The Winter Market</h3>
          <p>Winter had come to the Sprawl. Ice glazed the steel and concrete canyons. Case watched the snow fall through the polarized window of his loft. Somewhere out there, the matrix waited, a consensual hallucination.</p>

          <p>"I've watched through his eyes, I've listened through his ears, and I tell you he's the one. Or at least as close as we're going to get." "That's what you said about the brother." "The brother tested out impossible. For other reasons."</p>
          
          <h3>Chapter 7: Salamander</h3>
          <p>The battleroom was the center of life in Battle School. Ender floated in the center of the null-gravity chamber, surrounded by stars that weren't stars, enemies that weren't enemies, and a game that wasn't a game.</p>
          
          <h3>Chapter 14: Ender's Teacher</h3>
          <p>"The enemy's gate is down." It was Mazer Rackham's first lesson. It changed everything. Gravity was a weapon, a tool, a perspective. In the battle room, orientation was everything.</p>

          <h3>The Soldier's Tale</h3>
          <p>Fedmahn Kassad remembered the battles. He remembered the blood and the screams. But what he remembered most vividly was the woman. The woman who appeared in the midst of battle, untouched by the violence around her.</p>
          
          <h3>The Scholar's Tale</h3>
          <p>Sol Weintraub's tragedy was unique. His daughter, Rachel, had touched the Time Tombs and was aging backward. Each day she woke younger than the day before, her memories fading like morning mist.</p>

          <p>Hiro Protagonist approaches the Street. It is the Broadway, the Champs Élysées of the Metaverse. It is the brilliantly lit boulevard that can be seen, miniaturized and backward, reflected in the lenses of his goggles.</p>
          
          <h3>Chapter 45: The Raft</h3>
          <p>Floating in the middle of the Pacific, the Raft was a nation of refugees. Hiro watched as the sun set over the recycled plastic islands. Somewhere in this floating city was the answer to Snow Crash.</p>

          <h3>Chapter 5: The Domestication of Hunch</h3>
          <p>Genly Ai struggled to understand the Gethenians. They were androgynes, neither male nor female except during kemmer. How could he explain gender to people who experienced it only occasionally?</p>
          
          <h3>Chapter 10: On the Ice</h3>
          <p>The journey across the Gobrin Ice would kill them. Estraven knew it, and Genly knew it. Yet they had no choice. The sledge moved slowly across the endless white, two tiny figures against an ocean of snow.</p>
